# Programaci√≥ Concurrent

## Content
In this repository there are three directorys, where I store each one of the subject assigned exercises. 

### P1: Santa Claus' simulation
This exercise involves managing threads with mutexes and semaphores in Python. Santa releases his reindeer, helps the elves who need advice on crafting toys while the reindeer are in the stable, and finally, when the toys are ready, Santa lashes the reindeer and goes to deliver the presents.

### P2: the vending machine 
In this exercise, we manage threads using Ada's protected objects and monitors. The system simulates an empty vending machine where customers buy refreshments and stockers restock the machine until everyone has consumed their items.

### P3: the ilegal tobacconist
The final exercise is coded using channels with RabbitMQ's server in Go. An illegal tobacconist serves tobacco and fire to his customers until a snitch alerts him that the police are coming. At that point, the tobacconist hides the ilegal material and ends.
